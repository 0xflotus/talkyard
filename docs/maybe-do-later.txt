When doing these things, search for the tag too e.g. "[subcats]".

[subcats]
Implement sub categories.

[privacy-badger]:
Privacy Badger doesn't like transient session cookies, currently.
(See https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/2003#issuecomment-391745819  bullet point 3. )
So maybe change from csrf Double Submit Cookie, to Encrypted Token Pattern?

[no-email]:
Let people create accounts without specifying any email address. Like at Reddit.


[reenable-akismet]:
For some reason I disabled Akismet (why? when refactoring to save time?). Enable it again.


[flat-comments]:
Change layout of problem type topics to traditional forum flat comments layout.
& use for formal messages too, or maybe repl w chat?


[relfollow]:
Add a 'rel=follow links to domains: ...' config value,
so peope can follow links to their own domains.
Domains where rel=nofollow should not be added to links.
Will be applied to sub domains too, e.g. if you type `ex.com`, `sub.ex.com` will also
have rel=nofollow removed.
You should add the address of this forum, and your main website (if any),
so search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu will find all content.


[rand-page-id], [rand-user-id]:
Let outwardly visible page and user ids, be random numbers, to prevent
discovery of pages & people by iterating through all ids in the url.
64 bit random ids? or 32 bits + stricter rate limiting?


[subcomms]
Improve sub communities, e.g. selecting a category across all sub communities,
not only the current one.
