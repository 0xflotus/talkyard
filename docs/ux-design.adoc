Responsive design [6PFDS3]
==========================


Responsive design breakpoints elsewhere:

Tailwind:
  >= 640px)   small 'sm'
  >= 768px)   medium 'md'
  >= 1024px)  large 'lg'
  >= 1280px)  extra large 'xl'
  Can customize:

Bootstrap:
  .col-sm >= 576px  wide mobile  (approx between 320 and 768)
      But bad idea! iPhone SE is 568px, so always smaller.
  .col-md >= 768px  tablet
  .col-lg >= 992px  laptop  or tablet landscape
  .col-xl >= 1200px desktop (and many laptops too, 1920 is a frequent laptop width)
  Can be customized:
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#variables

480px is a frequent mobile px size too, e.g. iPhone SE


Wrist watches all seem to be:  < 300 px  (Aug 2020).

Nice naming ideas:  https://ricostacruz.com/til/css-media-query-breakpoints
"How should I name them?"
  â€” namely by X in X00,
  rather than "large", "small" etc, what's that anyway:
  If a small mobile is small or tiny, then, what's a watch? Extra tiny? Super tiny?
  And when my 14'' laptop is 1920 px = "extra large", then, what about a 30'' monitor?
  Extra e-e-extra-Extra Large?

  Talykard can use CSS classes  mw7  and mw10  and mw12
  to mean   min-width 768,  1024,   1280  etc,
  because designers typically know roughly how much 7NN px or 10NN px is.
