Talkyard Naming Notes
==========================

### Categories

Each forum:

Root category —> Main categories —> Sub categories —> (Sub sub categories? or not?)

A main category is called "Main", not "Top", because "top" could be
incorrectly interpreted as "popular".

Root categories are Talkyard internal things — end users never see them;
they never see the phrase "Root category".


### Cookies

Names like `tyCo...` so you can: `grep -r tyCo ./` and find all cookies.
(Right now it's `dwCo...`, should change to `tyCo`. RENAME )
