502 Bad Gateway

Nginx cannot connect to Play Framework. Is Play not running, or is there some network error? [EsE500BGW]

If you use Docker-Compose, please check if Play is running:  'docker-compose ps'

If it's not running, start it:  'docker-compose start play'
Then wait a few seconds and reload this page.

If it is running, check the logs:  'docker-compose logs'
