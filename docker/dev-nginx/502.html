502 Bad Gateway

Nginx cannot connect to Play Framework. Is Play not running, or is there some network error? [EsE500BGW]

If you use Docker-Compose, please check if the Play container is running:  'docker-compose ps'

If it's not running:
- Start it:  'docker-compose start play'. Then wait a few seconds and reload this page.
- Or login in a Bash shell:  'docker-compose run --rm --service-ports play bash'

If it is running:
- Check the logs:  'docker-compose logs'
- Only Play's logs: 'docker-compose logs play'
- Or jump into the container:  'docker-compose exec play bash'
