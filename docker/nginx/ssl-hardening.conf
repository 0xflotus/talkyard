# ------ Why this extra file

# Google says: """Important: The following directives should be positioned after
# the certificate and key directives in the SSL/TLS server block of your virtual host file.
# If you've defined a certificate authority PEM file, position these directives after
# the ssl_trusted_certificate directive; otherwise, position them after the
# ssl_certificate_key directive"""

# And Digital Ocean also says """The following directives must be placed after
# ssl_trusted_certificate""".

# ------ Gzip

# Could disable gzip for SSL traffic. See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
# But no, I don't want to disable it. Instead, don't echo back too private stuff in responses.
