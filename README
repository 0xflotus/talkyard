=============================

Debiki is an open source (AGPL) discussion platform for forums, blogs
and simple websites.

It intends to:

- Save time, by showing the interesting comments first,
  and solving the off-topic problem, and other things

- Promote fruitful discussions

- Help people better understand others with different points of view
  
Read more at http://www.debiki.com/.

A good alternative to Debiki might be [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) —
it has a different focus: a "flattened, endlessly scrolling discussion". It
does not intend to show the most interesting comments first.  I think that
Discourse is more like a combined forum + chat, and Debiki is more like a
combined forum/blog + Question/Answers site.

Debiki is under development and I have not yet released any stable
version or written any installation instructions.


Setting Up a Development Environment
=============================

Debiki is written in Scala, Javascript, LiveScript, HTML, CSS and SQL.
It uses Play Framework 2.1, PostgreSQL, jQuery, AngularJS and Node.js Grunt.

Here are the steps to get Debiki up and running on a virtual machine that you
can use for development. This should work on Windows, Linux and Mac.

1. Install things:

  - VirtualBox, www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads,
    or simply (on Ubuntu Linux) `apt-get install virtualbox`.

    [Here](http://blog.discourse.org/2013/04/discourse-as-your-first-rails-app/)
    are some tips (the *Step 1: VirtualBox*) section only).

  - Vagrant, which prepares a VirtualBox VM.
      You can download version 1.1.2 or higher from 
      [downloads.vagrantup.com](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/).

  - Git

    On Ubuntu: `apt-get install git`

    On Windows and Mac, consider using:

      <a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a>
      <a href="http://mac.github.com/">GitHub for Mac</a>


2. Get the source code

      git clone ...
      git submodule init
      git submodule update


3. Start a Virtual Machine

  The virtual machine (VM) will automatically have access to the source code
  you downloaded (via Git) to your desktop machine (Vagrant [syncs folder
  contents](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/index.html)).

  Start a virtual machine:

      vagrant up

  This takes long, because Vagrant installs e.g. PostgreSQL, Java and Node.js.


4. Start Debiki

      $ vagrant ssh
      $ cd ~/dev/debiki/debiki-app-play/
      $ scripts/play
      [...]$ run
  

  Then go to `http(s)://serveradress/-/install/` and follow the instructions.
 
  <sub>(If you're curious: The instructions tell you to find a password in the server
  log files, and then to input that password, so the server knows that you are
  you (in case other people also have access to the web pages, over the
  internet).  After this, you're asked to create an admin account.)</sub>
 
  Once you've installed everything, visit  http(s)://serveradress/-/admin/
  and create a forum or blog.

  You can shut down the virtual machine by hitting `vagrant halt` or `vagrant suspend`,
  and start it again via `vagrant up` or `vagrant resume`.

  Be careful with `vagrant destroy`, because then 1) any development database contents
  is lost, and 2) the next time you do `vagrant up` it'll take rather long.



Contributing
=============================

If you'd like to contribute any source code, please send me an email, or a
GitHub pull request but first sign this CLA (oops! it does not yet exist. But
it'll be similar to [Google's CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual)
— you'll open source your code and grant me a copyrigt license).

Please wrap lines if longer than 100 characters.
And, for Scala code, please use [the official style guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/).
For Javascript, use [Google's style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).

If you write a single line Git commit message, end it with `.` (a dot).
Please keep commit message lines below 80 characters.
