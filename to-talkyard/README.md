If importing from MySQL / PgSQL etc, maybe: https://github.com/tgriesser/knex


Initiallly cloned from: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter,
and everything now deleted except for things like tslint and some package.json settings.


If later on there'll be many stand-alone packages like this, then consider
using  https://lernajs.io/  ?  Maybe the slim-bundle, more-bundle etc could
be their own Lerna packages, hmm.
