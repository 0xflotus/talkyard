413 Request Entity Too Large  [TyE413ENTLRG]

You're uploading too much data, maybe a too large image or video?

***

This is Talkyard's Nginx server.

If you're server admin, you can configure Nginx so large files
are accepted:

In /opt/talkyard/docker-compose.yml, in the  services:  web:  environment:
section, add this environment variable, to allow files up to 75 megabytes:

      TY_NGX_LIMIT_REQ_BODY_SIZE: "75m"

Thereafter, recreate the 'web' container: (it runs Nginx)

      # Remove the current container.
      docker-compose kill web
      docker-compose rm -f web

      # Start a new container — it'll pick up the new config.
      docker-compose up -d web

      # Check the logs — all seems fine?
      # (The "LuaJIT version" alert is harmless)
      docker-compose logs -f web


However, it's possible that Talkyard's application server has been
configured to reject such large files. So you might also need to reconfigure
the app server — look in this file:
    /opt/talkyard/conf/play-framework.conf
Thereafter:
    docker-compose restart app
