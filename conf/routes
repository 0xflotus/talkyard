# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)
# ~~~~

# In Global.scala, routing is intercepted, and editPost/createPage/etc
# are called, based on the query string (e.g. ?edit=... or ?create-page).

# Static resources
GET   /-/assets/*file         controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)

# API calls
GET   /-/api/*apiPath         controllers.Application.callApi(apiPath)

# Home page
GET   /                       controllers.Application.index
