/** Actions builds up a page: a page consists of various posts,

  * design pattern.)
  *
  * PostActionDto is a rather stupid data transfer object (DTO): it's used
  * by DbDao, when saving and loading pages. â€” If you want some more
  * functionality, use the PostAction:s Post and Patch instead. (That's what you
  * almost have to do anyway because that's what Debate(/PageParts/whatever) gives you.)
  *
  * @param id A local id, unique per page. "?" means unknown (used when
  * creating new posts).
  * @param loginId the login session, which in turn identifies
  * the user and IP and session creation time.
  * @param newIp Always None, unless the post was sent from somewhere else than
  * the relevant Login.ip.
  * @param payload What this action does. For example, creates a new post,
  * edits a post, flags it, closes a thread, etcetera.
