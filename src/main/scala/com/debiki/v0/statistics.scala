   *
   *  We cannot use `fraction' directly, when sorting posts (or threads)
   *  by popularity.
   *  For example, assume a post has 1 rating, with the value "interesting".
   *  Then {@code fractioin} would be 1.0 (i.e. it'd be rated 100%
   *  "interesting")."
   *
   *  That 100% "interesting" post, with only 1 rating, would be
   *  ranked higher than a 95% interesting post with 100 ratings.
   *  -- although the 100-ratings post is probably more interesting
   *  than the 1-ratings.post.
   *
   *  To solve this, we can calculat confidence interval bounds on
   *  `fraction' (i.e. the values 100% and 90% above), and sort posts
   *  by the the lower bounds on `fraction' (instead of `fraction' itself).
   *
   *  How do we calculate confidence bounds on `fraction'?
   *
   *  Either a rating includes a certain tag, or it does not include it.
   *  So we have a binomial distribution --- except for the fact that
   *  the successes (i.e. when a rating *includes* the tag) are
   *  weighted by 1/the_number_of_other_tags_also_included_in_the_rating,
   *  i.e. weighted by values 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... 1/n, where `n' is the
   *  number of tags available.
   *
   *  I think we can consider the distribution a binomial distribution
   *  anyway. Therefore, I've used [a formula for calculating
   *  binomial proportion confidence intervals] to calculate
   *  a lower bound on `fraction'. Find details in the description of the
   *  function {@code binPropConfIntAC}.

  /** Uses the Agresti-Coull method to calculate upper and lower bounds
   *  of a binomial proportion 80% confidence interval.
   *  `percent' must currently be exactly 80.0f. (Because that's the
   *  only cumulative standard normal probability table value I've
   *  included in the function.)
   *
   *  The Agresti-Coull method is used because it works also for small
   *  sample sizes, i.e. < 30 samples (it'll probably be common with
   *  posts that have been rated only a few times).
   *  And because I think it's the simplest method.
   *
   *  The method works as follows. It basically adds 4 fake samples to the
   *  population, 2 with value 0 and 2 with value 1. Hence it works also
   *  when there's only one single sample (since it fakes 4 more samples).
   *  This is the formula:
   *
   *    Let n^ = number_of_samples + 4
   *
   *    Let p^ = number_of_successes + 2 / n^
   *      where number_of_successes is the number of successes in a
   *      Bernoulli trial process (e.g. flipping a coin n = 10 times,
   *      and considering each head a success).
   *
   *    Now, a confidence interval on the proportion can be calculated,
   *    like so:
   *      p^ +- Z_{1-Î±/2} sqrt( p^ (1 - p^) / n^)
   *
   *    where Z_{1-Î±/2} is the 1âÎ±/2 percentile of a standard
   *    normal distribution.
   *
   *  Let us (somewhat arbitrarily) choose Î± = 0.2 (i.e. 2 * 10%), and
   *  estimate a lower bound only (not an upper bound) for the proportion:
   *
   *      lower-bound = p^ - Z_{1-Î±/2} sqrt( p^ (1 - p^) / n^)
   *
   *  -Z_{1-0.2/2} = +Z_{10%} = -1.28. (That is, with a probability
   *  of 10%, a standard normal random value is < -1.28.)
   *
   *  Some nearby values:
   *    Z_{ 1%} = -2.33
   *    Z_{ 5%} = -1.65
   *    Z_{10%} = -1.28   <-- let's use 20%, 20% / 2 = 10%
   *    Z_{20%} = -0.84
   *
   *  Why 80%? 80% is (is it??) a fairly low percentile
   *  (95% or higher is more common?). The efefct should be that
   *  new posts (probably those with few ratings) are shown to
   *  relatively many people, instead of falling into oblivion, unread.
