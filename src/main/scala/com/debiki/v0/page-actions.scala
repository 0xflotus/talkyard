  *
  * @param id A local id, unique per page. "?" means unknown (used when
  * creating new posts).
  * @param loginId the login session, which in turn identifies
  * the user and IP and session creation time.
  * @param newIp Always None, unless the post was sent from somewhere else than
  * the relevant Login.ip.
  * @param payload What this action does. For example, creates a new post,
  * edits a post, flags it, closes a thread, etcetera.
