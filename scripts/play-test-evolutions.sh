# This is a test script for the Play database evolution scripts.
#
# It empties (drops and recreates) a schema meant for testing evolutions.
# The starts the Debiki server and runs some tests.
#
# The user and schema are hardcoded to "debiki_test_evolutions", and the
# password to "warning--this-schema-is-auto-dropped", so this script
# should be unable to drop the wrong schema.
# (You thus have to use that password when you create the related database user.)

set -e  # exit on non-zero command exit code
        # â€” otherwise we might not notice if some part of this test fails.

# ===== Load config values

function read_config_value {
  # Local values override the default ones (which are checked into the Git repo).
  # A row looks like so:
  #   some.config.key="some-config-value"

      | head -n1 \

# user and possibly drop the wrong schema.

# ===== Apply evolutions

# For now, since evolutions are handled by debiki-app-play, not debiki-dao-pgsql,
# start a server, wait for a while, then kill it.

# COULD have debiki-dao-pgsql use Play's JDBC module, then this wouldn't be needed.

Please press CTRL-C when evolutions have been applied.
That is, after the '[info] play - Listening for HTTP on ...' message.
Then this script will continue to run some database tests.

# ... Wait until human hits CTRL-C
# Oops! That kills this script, not just the server.
# So right now one needs to run the tests manually:
# ... (see below)
# Solution: Either have debiki-dao-pgsql apply evolutions itself,
# or send some flag to the Debiki server that it should die after having
# applied the evolutions.


# ===== Run database related tests.
