@* A function that loads CDN CSS from the local server in case we're offline.
(Looping through document.styleSheets and checking styleSheet.rules or .cssRules for the
relevant stylesheet didn't work, rules and cssRules were always null, could be
cross domain issue according to comments here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7452378/694469
So instead, if any Javascript fails to load, assume we're offline and
extra-load all styles, from debikiScripts.scala.html [93GK940])
