This Scala template includes a script that makes the web page a Weinre debug target.
For info on Weinre, and how to install it, see:
  http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/

Try to load the script from both `localhost` and the Android emulator's 10.0.2.2
address that resolves to localhost, in case we're showing this page in an emulated
Android browser.

Assume Weinre runs on port 8090 because usually I run Node.js' http-server on 8080
when testing embedded comments. 8080 is otherwise Weinre's default port.

You can start the Weinre server on your localhost like so:
 $ weinre --httpPort 8090 --boundHost -all-
