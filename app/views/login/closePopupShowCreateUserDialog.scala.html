  Facebook mobile app problem?
  Did you go to here, via Facebook's mobile app?
  Then you're likely using Facebook's built-in browser â€” which makes things break.

  @* Previously, this was caused by a Chrome v 63 bug, since long fixed (by Google).
  <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=796912">

  Copy the login URL, and log in outside Facebook instead.
  Or outside any other mobile app you might be using, if not Facebook?
