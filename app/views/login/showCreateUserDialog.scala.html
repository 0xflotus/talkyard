@* After OpenAuth or OpenID login authentication has been completed in this login popup window,
 * we here continue by showing a create user dialog. This is for embedded comments pages —
 * then, login and user creation always happens in a login popup window (this window).
 * — So don't call window.close() here. But in closePopupShowCreateUserDialog.scala.html we do the
 * same things, except that we also call window.close(), and continue in the opener instead.
