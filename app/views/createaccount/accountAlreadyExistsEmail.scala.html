@(userName: String, emailAddress: String, siteAddress: String)

Dear @userName,

You attempted to create a new account at <a href="@siteAddress">@siteAddress</a>,
but you already have an account there, with email address <tt>@emailAddress</tt>.
If you don't remember your password, you can
<a href="@siteAddress@routes.ResetPasswordController.showResetPasswordPage">
  reset it here.</a>

Kind regards,
Debiki
