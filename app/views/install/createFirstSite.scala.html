    <p>
      Please show me that you are the person installing this software,
      and not someone else, by typing a password below.
      You'll find the password in the server log files,
      usually located in: <tt>server-installation-dir/logs/application.log</tt>

      @* COULD show another err mess if the problem is e.g.:  PSQLException: ERROR: relation "dw1_posts" does not exist,
      i.e. that db evolution script 1.sql in debiki-dao-pgsql failed  *@
      Bad password, please try again.

      You might wonder why am I doing this?
      Well, in case this page is accessible to <em>anyone</em> over the <em>internet</em>,
      I better verify that you are indeed the person that operates this server.
      â€” I generated and saved a password in the server log files,
      because only you should have access to them.
